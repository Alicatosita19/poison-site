<h1> Arsenic</h1>
<h2>aar-suh-nuhk</h2>
<p1> Arsenic is a naturally occurring toxic element that can be found all around in the air, water, and soil.</p1>
    <br>
<p2> Arsenic though mainly organic can also be man made/inorganic.</p2>
    <br>
<p3> Tho arsenic is poisonus it is much more poisonus when it is man made versus found naturally.</p3>
    <br>
<p4> You can also find arsenic in apple seeds tho it is not that strong.</p4>
    <br>
<p5> If you are trying to poison someone this is much better for a long term poisoning plan. After a long term exposure from arsenic it is possible to develop cancer or skin lesions.</p5>
    <br>
<p6> You can tell if you have skin lesion if you have abnormal skin such as moles, spots [not freckles, or pimples], bumps, or other growth. </p6>
    <br>
<p7> Skin lesion can cause infections such as chickenpox[Chicken pox is a highly contagus virus that causes itchy rashes, red sports, ad fluid-filled blister.], scabies[It causes itching and a rash], warts[Non cancerous skin growth.], shingles[painfulrash], or cellulitis [bacteria inefections].</p7>
